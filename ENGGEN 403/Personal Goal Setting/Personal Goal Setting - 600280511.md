# Personal Goal Setting - 600280511

## Reflection

Generally, in a team I am less vocal than most others. I prefer to listen. However, there are moments where I believe strongly in a position where I will present my arguments in a discussion. I am also often very blunt, people have commented on this and have been affected emotionally by this. Nowadays, I try to recognise when I am too harsh and address it immediately by apologising and rephrasing my comment. 

I have been the leader in several teams in the past. As a leader I also listen frequently, but I notice that I talk more, not just in terms of managing a meeting, but also in giving an initial stance for a topic and asking team members to discuss.  I've discovered that I do not enjoy being the leader of a team, as the extra responsibility often leads to stress. 

As the leader of a team project, I did not provide deadlines or assign tasks, but instead chose a Kanban style of working with a shared pool of tasks that each person was expected to work on. However, this backfired, with the workload not being shared equally and less progress than expected. Consequently, I learned that to hold team members accountable, tasks should be given specifically and with deadlines. The deadlines should also be well ahead of actual deliverable deadlines to allow extra time for issues that may arise.

Another instance in that project was when I had to make the hard decision to discard of a significant amount of work that we were blocked on. The team member that was pushing for this feature was frustrated and disheartened, and I saw this. But I did not comfort them, I assumed that their closer friends would notice too and help. I learned from this to be more cognizant of other's feelings when delivering negative news and take the initiative to comfort others.

This behaviour stems from my introversion, I prefer gatherings of small groups. I also prefer to have time to myself, which explains why I prefer being a team member rather than a leader, as the leader is more involved with the entire team and has less "alone" time.

The strengths I see in myself are that I learn quickly and perform tasks quickly. I am proactive in completing tasks that are assigned to me, however I may not point out issues that come up during discussion and often don't mind not commenting on things I disagree on until the leader asks for opinions.

In situations where I am harsh they may view me as mean, or not caring. However, I think my teammates view me as an effective and intelligent team member in most situations.

## Personal SMART goal

I will be more cognizant of others feelings throughout the course of the project. To do this I will pause before giving bad news. If I do think I am harsh, I will apologise and deliver the news in a more considerate manner. This will be reviewed by personal reflection and asking team members if I have offended them. There should be less than two instances of this kind of altercation occurring.

I will be more proactive in meetings by challenging or agreeing with an idea at least once during each meeting. This will increase my engagement with the team and include my ideas into the discussion.

In meetings, I will push for deadlines and specific assignees for tasks. I will question who and when a task is due. The goal is to increase accountability and cohesion of the team.
