## Personal Reflection

During ENGGEN 403, you have learnt about personal strengths and weaknesses, teamwork, value, and systems thinking. You applied this knowledge to two projects. The first assignment required you to set some goals. Now, is the time to reflect on your learnings. 
-Background/context, what happened?
-What did you think/feel? What worked/didn't work?
-What did you learn?
-What will you do next time?

1) What is the most important lesson or lessons you learnt during  the course? 

2) Did you accomplish the S.M.A.R.T. goals you set yourself in the  Personal Goal Setting assignment for Systems projects? Why or  why not

The most important lesson I learnt in ENGGEN 403 is that my personal strengths and weaknesses play a major role in determining how I can help my team and myself. I also learnt that my values and the values of my team members play a crucial role in how we work together.

 Some things that worked well in our group was the way we shared tasks, both oral and written. We also had a timeline for when each of us should be doing something, which helped us to complete our project on time.

I think the only thing that didn't work as well as I would have liked it to was the way we broke down different parts of the project for each other. For example, sometimes a person would do a task and then move onto another one without being sure if someone else had already done it or not. This made it hard for some people to know what to do next. I plan on starting meetings with an overview of what has been done so far so everyone is aware of what needs to be completed next.  

I think the most important lesson I learnt is that you need to know your strengths and weaknesses in order to work effectively with a team. It's also important to keep an open mind about new information. Another lesson I learned during this course is to always focus on what works. When I get into a situation that doesn't work out, I need to take time to figure out what did not work. The problem with focusing on what did not work is it becomes a never-ending cycle. By focusing on what did work, you are able to see where the problem really lies and fix it.

I think I accomplished my S.M.A.R.T. goals for the Systems project assignment because I set clear deadlines for myself and others, even though they weren't always met due to other commitments that came up. We also had a timeline for when each of us should be doing something, which helped us to complete our project on time.

This course has given me a better understanding of teamwork and personal strengths. I now know how to work with my strengths to help the team, but also know when to ask for help from others as well.
