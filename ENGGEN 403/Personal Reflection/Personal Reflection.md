## Personal Reflection

For the semester, ENGGEN 403 held two significant projects. The first was the mini-systems week which introduced us to our team members for the project and tried to answer whether a bridge designed for cyclists and pedestrians over the Auckland Harbour Bridge was feasible. The second was much more intense and answered whether it was possible and how we would convert 150,000 ha of livestock land in the Canterbury Plains to agriculture and viticulture.

The most important lesson I learnt in ENGGEN 403 is that my personal strengths and weaknesses play a major role in determining how to help my team and myself. I also learnt that my values and the values of my team members play a crucial role in how we work together.

One thing that worked well in our group was how we shared tasks, both oral and written. We also had a timeline for when we should be doing something, which helped us complete our project on time.

The only thing that didn't work as well as I would have liked it to was the way we broke down different parts of the project for each other. For example, sometimes, a person would do a task and then move on to another one without being sure if someone else had already done it or not. This made it hard for some people to know what to do next. I plan to start meetings with an overview of what has been done so far, so everyone knows what needs to be completed next.  

I think the most important lesson I learnt is that you need to know your strengths and weaknesses to work effectively with a team. It's also important to keep an open mind about new information. Another lesson I learned during this course is to always focus on what works. When I get into a situation that doesn't work out, I need to figure out what did not work. The problem with focusing on what did not work is it becomes a never-ending cycle. By focusing on what did work, you can see where the problem lies and fix it.

I also learnt how valuable systems thinking is when solving problems. Working together with other team members to find solutions was eye-opening because we were always trying to find new ways of looking at issues. 

I accomplished my S.M.A.R.T. goals for the Systems project assignment because I set clear deadlines for myself and others, even though they weren't always met due to other commitments that came up. We also had a timeline for when we should be doing something, which helped us complete our project on time.

This course has given me a better understanding of teamwork and personal strengths. I now know how to work with my strengths to help the team and know when to ask for help from others.
