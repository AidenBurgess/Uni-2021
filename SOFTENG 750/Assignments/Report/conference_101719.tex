\section{Introduction}


\subsection{Motivation}
Students need to remove all distractions to study effectively. However, the process of setting up a relaxing environment for a session of focused work can be tedious and repetitive. Many students prefer to study with music in the background and with a nice wallpaper. When working on large problems or many problems, they like to break them down into smaller tasks in a todo list. It has become increasingly popular to use time-boxed techniques to maximise efficiency and focus, such as Pomodoro. Therefore, students may need to juggle many apps simultaneously, which can be distracting and annoying.

A unique feature that the team thought would be worthwhile to introduce is the ability to change the background and music based on the user's current mood.

\subsection{Goals}
The goals for this project were separated by priority into must-haves, should-haves, could-haves, and nice-to-haves. The list of proposed goals for the project can be found in Table 1.

As a summary, the main goals for the project was the mood-based functionality, which interacted with the background and music, and the todo list. These were chosen as the main goals because the unique feature of a mood.... The todo list is one of the most important components needed when a student is studying as it allows them to track their goals and progress for the study session.

With the same reasoning, white noise and a timer were should have functionality, as they aid a user's study.

%BELOW IS ALL COPIED, NEED TO CHANGE AND MERGE WITH PRESENTATION

The preliminary market research revealed that no app exists with all the proposed app’s functionality. However, some apps/services exist which partially provide one of the features from our proposed feature-set. Below is a discussion on other apps which offer our top three features.

Spotify provides in-app music recommendations based on the user’s song history. Besides individual songs, Spotify recommends playlists which we will reproduce in our app. However, Spotify does not have any mood sliders based on which the current queue of songs. This is a feature which we will add to our app. 

The ‘mood backgrounds’ feature is something that no app currently offers. However, an app called ‘MoodTurn’ allows the user to choose a background category such as ‘beach’ or ‘nature’, then starts a background slideshow whilst playing soothing music associated with the pictures. We aim to keep the slideshow feature from this app, but instead of picture categories, we will have a way to change the pictures dynamically based on the user’s mood. 

Todoist is a comprehensive app that allows the user to create todo lists. It has a plethora of features, such as creating recurring events and delegating tasks to other people. While we will keep some basic features of this app, such as arranging the tasks date-wise, we do not aim to include the other complex features in our app.


\section{Design}
\subsection{Visual Design}
The visual design process began with an ideation phase, where each team member came up with some ideas for the overall design of the app. Some ideas were to have the components as widgets floating on the screen, hacing a grid with the components fixed in place, having the components in tabs, and having a main menu to reach the components. 

From this, each of the ideas was ranked by each team member, and the idea with the highest rank was chosen, which was to have the copmonents as widgets floating on the screen.

After this phase, we collaborated on Mural to produce lo-fi prototypes for some of the components and screens (Fig \ref{prototyping}.)

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{prototyping.png}}
\caption{Lo-fi prototyping process.}
\label{prototyping}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Architectural Design}
An overview of our design for the system architecture can be found in Figure \ref{project-architecture}. It follows a common industry pattern of a frontend, which is connected to the backend, and a backend connected to the database. This pattern ensures that user requests are validated and authorised by the backend before reaching the database, improving security and reducing complexity and processing in the frontend.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{project-architecture.png}}
\caption{Project architecture.}
\label{project-architecture}
\end{figure}

The frontend is responsible for serving the website interface to users. It retrieves data from the backend, and displays it to the user. It also handles the logic of the website, such as inputs for the mood, playing a slideshow of backgrounds, and playing music. The timer component is purely in the frontend as there is no data or external apis associated with it.

The backend of this application has two main functions. Firstly, it validates, authorises and executes user queries on the database, such as changing the mood or adding a todo item. This is the use case for the mood component and the todo component. Secondly, it handles interactions with other external apis and preprocesses the data to return to the user. This function is used for the music API and background API.

The database role and schema is relatively simple. It stores the mood and todo list data per session. Each session can either belong to a user, or to a guest. There is no storage needed for the music, timer or background components.

\section{Implementation}
Note: In this section I will talk solely about my individual contributions to the project.

From the project roadmap (Fig \ref{roadmap}.), we can see there are seven main epics for the project. I worked on the mood slider and timer components. The mood slider also required integration with the spotify and background components. I also developed the login page of the application and styling for my components.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{project-roadmap.png}}
\caption{Project roadmap.}
\label{roadmap}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Timer}
The simplest and first component that I implemented is the timer component (top left Fig \ref{homepage}.). It does not require any backend or database interaction, as it is a purely frontend component. I started by using an existing component I found online for the timer component. Then, I added a validated user input to specify the time requested, and the buttons for starting and stopping the timer.

\subsection{Mood Slider}
Next was the mood slider (bottom left Fig \ref{homepage}.). The frontend of the mood component was again started from an existing component I found online. This required a database to store the moods per user, so I created a MongoDB Cloud database for the project. The schema for the mood was a nested mood object consisting of five fields inside a larger user object. The backend code was located in the route \codeword{api/mood}. I also implemented the backend testing for the overall user route, which contained the functionality for moods and todo lists.

Finally, the mood needed to be integrated with the background and music components. The mood was stored in the application globally and the \codeword{useEffect()} function was used to react to changes in this state. When the mood changes, the background and spotify components both update. The background component has more complex functionality as there is no direct way to map the mood to a background. Therefore, a \codeword{moodToSearchParser} was developed acting as a translator. For example, if valence is high then the term "happy" is added to the search terms used to find backgrounds.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{homepage.png}}
\caption{Application homepage.}
\label{homepage}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Sign-in Page}
Near the end of the project, I was assigned with styling the homepage, as it was empty with two buttons. From some quick research I found that the login and sign buttons were often offset on a homepage, so I designed the homepage following this pattern (Fig \ref{signin}.). Originally I used a static image, but I found that a GIF with a starfield animation was more engaging. The GIF used is a well known meme around studying called the lofi girl.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{signin.png}}
\caption{Application sign in page.}
\label{signin}
\end{figure}

\section{Testing}
Our application has tests for both the frontend and backend systems.

Shallow and snapshot testing was performed on the frontend. Shallow testing is rendering a single component and asserting its behaviour. It allows us to check that the component is loaded correctly while ignoring the implementation of the children elements. "A [sic] snapshot test renders a UI component, takes a snapshot, then compares it to a reference snapshot file stored alongside the test.\cite{b1}" It ensures that no unexpected changes occur between versions.

Backend testing was performed via Jest and mocks. As our project relies heavily on external APIs, we had to mock these services when writing unit tests for the application. This decouples the correctness of our application from the correctness of the APIs we use. We used an in-memory mongodb server to reduce coupling between the backend and database, and to improve test speed.

\section{Methodology}
Our team followed an Agile process, with one team leader, and two team meetings per week. We also utilised many technologies such as Jira, GitHub, and Discord to manage our project.

\subsection{Technologies}
\subsubsection{Jira}
Jira is a product by Atlassian to manage a project's tickets and progress (Fig \ref{progress}.). We utilised it heavily to track what tasks team members were assigned, and to manage our weekly sprints. Jira has a built-in sprint board, and backlog which synergized with our Agile approach.

\subsubsection{Github}
We utilised GitHub as our version control system of choice. A new branch was created on GitHub for each ticket on Jira. The naming convention of the branches included the ticket id and the feature, for example \codeword{AnubhavKhanna07/SAT-84/timer-colour-dark-mode}. This allowed tickets to be tracked more easily. After the feature was implemented, a pull request was made against the main branch and at least one other member commented or approved the request (Fig \ref{github}.). GitHub Actions was also utilised to automatically run the frontend and backend tests on each pull request. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{github-network.png}}
\caption{GitHub network map.}
\label{github}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Discord}
Discord is a messaging application with built in voice channels, video streaming, and screen-sharing. We used it in this project for most of our communication, and for video calls. I also integrated it with GitHub so that each action on the repository such as test results and pull requests was shown in Discord.

\subsubsection{Messenger}
Messenger is Facebook's messaging platform, which focuses on more real-time interaction. As each team member used Facebook, we would be notified immediately about new messages, so this was used for more timely discussions and reminders (Fig \ref{messenger}.). There is only a single channel, which makes it difficult to manage multiple conversations and topics, so Discord was used in conjunction with Messenger.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{messenger.png}}
\caption{Example Messenger messages.}
\label{messenger}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Agile}
The Agile methodology is a software development process which focuses on iterative development and fast iterations \cite{b2}. Out team held one-week long sprints, and Jira helped track these. The sprints started on Monday, and we held a mid-sprint review on Thursdays to check if anyone had any significant blockers or interesting things to report.

On Monday, we reviewed the sprint, and work was assigned to each team member. During this session we discussed what had been completed and what we could do in the next week. 

From the progress chart \ref{progress}, we can see that there is constant progress on the application every week, with the jumps in "To Do" occuring each Monday as tasks were assigned. As the deadline approached, the workload seems to increase, as smaller tickets such as bugfixes are added.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{cumulative-flow-diagram.png}}
\caption{Cumulative progress chart.}
\label{progress}
\end{figure}

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Progress on Goals}
Our team implemented all of the must-haves, one of the should-haves, and one of the could-haves. The should-have that was implemented was the timer. The could-have that was implemented was the user accounts feature.

Along with these goals that were specified at the beginning of the project, other smaller features were also added to the system. A homepage was added which was not originally in the design, and we were not originally planning on having a database or backend, but these were added as the user accounts feature was added.


\subsection{Challenges}
One of the challenges we faced was that the team leader Samuel was in Australia for the first seven weeks of the project, so we had to hold our meetings online via Discord and Zoom for most of the project.

Another challenge was working with the Spotify player API, we found that there are frustrating parts of the Spotify API, such as needing Spotify premium to play music through Spotify player api, and the authentication protocols were proprietary and difficult to learn.

I also was challenged personally when implementing backend tests, as I had not dealt with mocking before.

\section{Conclusion}
%Conclusions? Lessons? Future work?
Overall, the project was successful and we met most of our planned goals, and even added more features as the project progressed. However, there are still many features that we plan to implement in the future. White noise is a common study aid tool which I believe is a key benefit to our application. Another useful feature would be the whiteboard, as a todo list can only record text, some thoughts and notes are not recordable currently.

The biggest learnings through this project for me were working effectively in a team remotely, the power of project management through Jira, and backend testing using Jest.
