\section{Introduction}


\subsection{Motivation}
Students need to remove all distractions to study effectively. However, the process of setting up a relaxing environment for a session of focused work can be tedious and repetitive. Many students prefer to study with music in the background and with a nice wallpaper. When working on large problems or many problems, they like to break them down into smaller tasks in a todo list. It has become increasingly popular to use time-boxed techniques to maximise efficiency and focus, such as Pomodoro. Therefore, students may need to juggle many apps simultaneously, which can be distracting and annoying.

A unique feature that the team thought would be worthwhile to introduce is the ability to change the background and music based on the user's current mood.

\subsection{Goals}
The goals for this project were separated by priority into must-haves, should-haves, could-haves, and nice-to-haves. The list of proposed goals for the project can be found in Table 1.

As a summary, the main goals for the project was the mood-based functionality, which interacted with the background and music, and the todo list. These were chosen as the main goals because the unique feature of a mood.... The todo list is one of the most important components needed when a student is studying as it allows them to track their goals and progress for the study session.

With the same reasoning, white noise and a timer were should have functionality, as they aid a user's study.

%BELOW IS ALL COPIED, NEED TO CHANGE AND MERGE WITH PRESENTATION

The preliminary market research revealed that no app exists with all the proposed app’s functionality. However, some apps/services exist which partially provide one of the features from our proposed feature-set. Below is a discussion on other apps which offer our top three features.

Spotify provides in-app music recommendations based on the user’s song history. Besides individual songs, Spotify recommends playlists which we will reproduce in our app. However, Spotify does not have any mood sliders based on which the current queue of songs. This is a feature which we will add to our app. 

The ‘mood backgrounds’ feature is something that no app currently offers. However, an app called ‘MoodTurn’ allows the user to choose a background category such as ‘beach’ or ‘nature’, then starts a background slideshow whilst playing soothing music associated with the pictures. We aim to keep the slideshow feature from this app, but instead of picture categories, we will have a way to change the pictures dynamically based on the user’s mood. 

Todoist is a comprehensive app that allows the user to create todo lists. It has a plethora of features, such as creating recurring events and delegating tasks to other people. While we will keep some basic features of this app, such as arranging the tasks date-wise, we do not aim to include the other complex features in our app.


\section{Design}
%Software architecture (e.g. class diagram)? User interface (e.g. screen diagram)? Why this design?

\subsection{Visual Design}
The visual design process began with an ideation phase, where each team member came up with some ideas for the overall design of the app. Some ideas were to have the components as widgets floating on the screen, hacing a grid with the components fixed in place, having the components in tabs, and having a main menu to reach the components. 

From this, each of the ideas was ranked by each team member, and the idea with the highest rank was chosen, which was to have the copmonents as widgets floating on the screen.

After this phase, we collaborated on Mural to produce lo-fi prototypes for some of the components and screens (Fig \ref{prototyping}.)

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{prototyping.png}}
\caption{Lo-fi prototyping process.}
\label{prototyping}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Architectural Design}
An overview of our design for the system architecture can be found in Figure \ref{project-architecture}. It follows a common industry pattern of a frontend, which is connected to the backend, and a backend connected to the database. This pattern ensures that user requests are validated and authorised by the backend before reaching the database, improving security and reducing complexity and processing in the frontend.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{project-architecture.png}}
\caption{Project architecture.}
\label{project-architecture}
\end{figure}

The frontend is responsible for serving the website interface to users. It retrieves data from the backend, and displays it to the user. It also handles the logic of the website, such as inputs for the mood, playing a slideshow of backgrounds, and playing music. The timer component is purely in the frontend as there is no data or external apis associated with it.

The backend of this application has two main functions. Firstly, it validates, authorises and executes user queries on the database, such as changing the mood or adding a todo item. This is the use case for the mood component and the todo component. Secondly, it handles interactions with other external apis and preprocesses the data to return to the user. This function is used for the music API and background API.

The database role and schema is relatively simple. It stores the mood and todo list data per session. Each session can either belong to a user, or to a guest. There is no storage needed for the music, timer or background components.

Note: In this section I will talk solely about my individual contributions to the project.

From the project roadmap, we can see there are seven main epics for the project. I worked on the mood slider and timer components.

\section{Discussion}
%Have the goals been achieved? Problems?

\subsection{Progress on Goals}
Our team implemented all of the must-haves, two of the should-haves, and one of the could-haves. 

Along with these goals that were specified at the beginning of the project, other smaller features were also added to the system. A homepage was added which was not originally in the design


\subsection{Challenges}
One of the challenges we faced was that Sam was in Australia for the first 7 weeks of the project, so we had to hold our meetings online via Discord and Zoom

Another challenge was working with the spotify player api, as many teams have discussed previously, there are some frustrating parts of the spotify api, such as needing spotify premium to play music through spotify player api, and authentication protocols were proprietary and difficult to learn
