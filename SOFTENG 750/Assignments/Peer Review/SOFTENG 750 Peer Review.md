# SOFTENG 750 Peer Review

## Aiden Burgess - abur970



## Teammates Contribution

I am very happy with all my teammates, I feel like we had fair and constant deadlines which meant that each week everyone was contributing. Sam did a great job organising and leading the project, and our core functionalities were completed well ahead of time.

## Project Group Peer Review

Attended their presentations

Looked at their repositories

Ran their code and played around with their system (or at least tried to)

Put some thought into what they have done well and what they could improve.

### Group 17

The presentation overall was excellent, and it was professional. To improve the introduction, there could have been discussion about motivations. The design section of the presentation also could have been improved by talking about how design was thought about, references, and process. I was very interested in the presentation and impressed by how the application looked and the development process.

The project itself is extremely polished and has incredible functionality. It is a full social media application with posts, likes, comments, and sharing. I agree with the authors that the profile section can be expanded in the future with custom profile pictures, but it is already very impressive. The technical complexity of the project introduces many new technologies, such as TailwindCSS, Jotai, render.com, react storybooks etc. The project has also been fully deployed with both the frontend and backend being hosted.

Something of note is the GitHub contributions for the project, which show a disproportionate amount of code being contributed by Albert Gao, while the Evan and Yuxin appear to have similar levels of work.

Another anomaly from the GitHub contributions is Henry (syan386), who has 6 commits, over the course of the last 2 days of the project implementation. Further evidence can be found on the homepage containing meeting minutes, where Henry is only mentioned twice. In contrast Albert is mentioned 33 times, Yuxin, 23 times, and Evan 4 times. There could be many explanations for this, but on the surface this is concerning and should be investigated.
