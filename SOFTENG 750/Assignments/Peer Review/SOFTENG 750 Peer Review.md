# SOFTENG 750 Peer Review

## Aiden Burgess - abur970



## Teammates Contribution

Very happy with all my teammates, I feel like we had fair and constant deadlines which meant that each week everyone was contributing. Sam did a great job organising and leading the project, and our core functionalities were completed well ahead of time.

## Project Group Peer Review

### Group 17

Something of note is the GitHub contributions for the project, which show a disproportionate amount of code being contributed by Albert Gao, while the Evan and Yuxin appear to have similar levels of work.

Another anomaly from the GitHub contributions is Henry (syan386), who has 6 commits, over the course of the last 2 days of the project implementation. Further evidence can be found on the homepage containing meeting minutes, where Henry is only mentioned twice. In contrast Albert is mentioned 33 times, Yuxin, 23 times, and Evan 4 times. There could be many explanations for this, but on the surface this is concerning and should be investigated.
