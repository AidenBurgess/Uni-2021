### Project 5 - Industry/Gov questions about law

In the age of digital information, one part of information remains stubbornly opaque - the law. Past research has shown that access to legal counsel is unequal, forcing underprivileged people into worse outcomes [^1]. There are 37 lawyers serving middle to high income individuals for every lawyer serving low-income individuals [^1]. This increases fines, penalties, and sentences for those who can least afford it, turning the legal system and therefore society into one where the rich thrive.  The law is unfortunately complicated and there exists a desperate need for transparency of the law, for the sake of those whom cannot afford it.

Society is built upon these laws, governing the way everyday citizens live. Improving the effectiveness and clarity of these laws through research can contribute to a fairer society. Having well-researched laws leads to better outcomes for those impacted by those laws. Often, laws may pass which have unintended consequences, which may waste resources - the time, energy and monetary cost required to pass the legislation.

### Project 8 - EV Club Hub

Society has become more climate conscious over the last few decades. The effects of climate change are already being felt across the world, with only more extreme and drastic ramifications on the horizon[^2].  Heat waves, extreme rainfall and droughts are becoming more commonplace each year. Not enough is being done to curb reduce global emissions. It is hard to get people passionate about something that is happening gradually and whose full effects are not yet upon us.

Sadly, this means that the world is not moving fast enough towards a renewable future [^3]. The current young generation and future generations are left to suffer the impact of today's excessiveness. It is even more disheartening that those who contribute the least to the problem are likely to bear the largest losses (ref). Therefore, it is imperative that today's generation is engaged and consciously supporting the health of our planet.

### Project 13 - Memory Manager

The world is aging. The median age has increased from 21 in 1970 to over 30 years old in 2020, with this expected to increase to over 40 by the end of the century [^4] . But with age comes a problem. Older generations experience the effects of aging, which often come with high health related costs, and various problems and diseases. In New Zealand, the older population uses 42% of health services when, but make up only 15% of the general population [^5]. This trend has only been increasing over the past decade.

Frustratingly, the very people who would benefit the most from the digital health revolution are those who are the least familiar and comfortable with technology. This inequality threatens to hinder the great economic and social benefits that this revolution should bring. We should include the older demographic in the digital health revolution.
