# Agile Discovery - Aiden Burgess



Gentrack was my first experience with an Agile environment. Although it was a bit limited as I was in a team of three interns who were working on a separate project. We created our own tasks as we discovered them and used a Kanban style of working, with assigned tasks and a deadline set for a set of tasks set by our manager.







SOFTENG 306 Project 2. Started off with a Kanban style of work. I was the leader and in my personal work I prefer having just a bunch of tasks in a backlog which I continuously pull off. I didn't assign tasks and there weren't clear deadlines for tasks either. The team got less work than expected completed, we were falling behind, there was an unequal work load. Some people like to procrastinate so this style of Agile did not work well for our team. Also there was not much accountability as we held meetings infrequently (no daily standups), so people didn't realise that others were getting work done. As the project deadlines approached I recognised these issues and changed added clear deadlines and assigned people with specific tasks. We grinded and got the work done, although there were some team conflicts.



Amazon internship experience in an Agile team. Initially following pretty strict scrum. Daily standups combined with ops talk was 1h+ each day. We had a retrospective, where we identified major issues. Estimates were not working out. The amount of time spent in meetings was too excessive. We debated between kanban and a kanban + scrum mix.
